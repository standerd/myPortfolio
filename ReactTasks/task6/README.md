In this code example you should see how to
1. Create and and render and element using React
2. See how to use JSX
3. See how to use React-Bootstrap
4. See how to add your own custom stylesheets

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, do the following:
1. Copy the directory called 'example' to your local machine.
2. Navigate to this directory from the command line interface. E.g. cd c:\example.
3. In the command line interface type 'npm install'
4. Now type 'npm start'. Runs the app in the development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Do the following:
1. run the code to see the output in your browser using the instructions above.
2. open css/custom.css to see the simple custom stylsheet that was added for this example.
3. Open public/index.html. This is the page that is dispalyed in the browser when the react app runs.
4. Now find the div with id="root". Take note of this. This is the element where the React element we create in src/index.js is added.
5. Now open src/index.js and read through the comments.

As you can see, there are many other files in this app we are ignoring for now. These files are created automatically when
we use CRA to create a React app. We will see how some of these files fit together in the next task. Once you learn Node.js (which you
will very soon) much of what is happening in this app will also become clearer.
